Welcome to the Online Automated System for Instant Stats(O.A.S.I.S.)

Tesseract-OCR is used to grab player usernames and eliminations(kills) in real time, and updates a google spreadsheet. 

Requirements:
1.) Tesseract-OCR must be installed in the same directory as the EXE. (folder called Tesseract-OCR with its exe called tesseract.exe)
2.) Google Sheets shared with the bot.
3.) The second page of sheets is in the same layout as the example sheet.
4.) client_key.json file in the same directory as exe.
5.) client_key.json filled out the required info. (Currently, it's blank)
6.) The scoreboard that is being captured must be on the main monitor. (This may be dealt with in the future, but you can change your main monitor to a side one, and it will be fine)

Instructions:
1.) Run the EXE file.
2.) Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information. (it will save provided inputs, making subsequential runs of the program quicker to start)
3.) When you no longer have prompts (after you select how many teams), click and drag to select where each team is. 
4.) Check the Google sheet and ensure data is being added.
5.) To end the program, press ctrl+c in the terminal or close it.

Note.) If the program stops working midway through, you can restart it, and it should be fine
